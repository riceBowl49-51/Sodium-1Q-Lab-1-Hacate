        <p>Red spider lilies, also known as higanbana in Japanese, 
        are deeply symbolic flowers primarily associated with death and the afterlife, 
        particularly in East Asian cultures. They are often found in graveyards and near temples, 
        and their bright red color can evoke images of blood or fire, 
        further reinforcing their connection to mortality.
        However, they also symbolize transformation, reincarnation, 
        and the cyclical nature of life, especially in the context of rebirth.</p>
